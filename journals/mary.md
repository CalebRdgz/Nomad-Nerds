* Our group worked together with Arthur screen sharing
* We realized that we didn't actually need any models besides Favorite and User and decided that we most likely won't need the Business microservice since we can pull all business, location, and category data from the Yelp API instead
* We worked on creating FastAPI routes and testing them out using the Yelp API
* We still need to figure out how to sort the data that we get back regarding categories and count since we're currently returning an unsorted list and we're hoping to rank the categories by count
